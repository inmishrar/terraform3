# Hub network

This module deploys a hub network using the [Microsoft recommended Hub-Spoke network topology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke). Generally there should only be one hub in each region with multiple spokes, where each of them can also be in separate subscriptions. Currently it does not support setting up peering between hub's in different regions, but that could be added as a feature later.

The virtual network will be created with 4 subnets, AzureFirewallSubnet, GatewaySubnet, Management and DMZ. AzureFirewallSubnet and GatewaySubnet will not contain any UDR (User Defined Route) or NSG (Network Security Group) since that is not possible with resources deployed in those subnets. Management and DMZ will route all outgoing traffic through firewall instance.

In diagram hub network is connected to on-premise network, but works just as well with public network.

## Usage

To create a simple hub network with no additional firewall or nsg rules deployed using [tau](https://github.com/avinor/tau).

```terraform
module {
    source = "avinor/virtual-network-hub/azurerm"
    version = "1.2.0"
}

inputs {
    name = "hub"
    resource_group_name = "networking-hub"
    location = "westeurope"
    address_space = "10.0.0.0/24"
}
```

For a more complete example with firewall rules and custom nsg rules added to management and application gateway subnet:

```terraform
module {
    source = "avinor/virtual-network-hub/azurerm"
    version = "1.2.0"
}

inputsÂ {
    name = "hub"
    resource_group_name = "networking-hub-rg"
    location = "westeurope"
    address_space = "10.0.0.0/24"

    diagnostics = {
        destination = "/subscription/xxxx-xxxx/.../resource_id"
        eventhub_name = null
        logs = ["all"]
        metrics = ["all"]
    }

    management_nsg_rules = [
    {
        name = "allow-ssh"
        direction = "Inbound"
        access = "Allow"
        protocol = "Tcp"
        source_port_range          = "*"
        destination_port_range     = "22"
        source_address_prefix      = "VirtualNetwork"
        destination_address_prefix = "VirtualNetwork"
    },
    ]

    dmz_nsg_rules = [
    {
        name                       = "allow-all-http"
        direction                  = "Inbound"
        access                     = "Allow"
        protocol                   = "Tcp"
        source_port_range          = "*"
        destination_port_range     = "80"
        source_address_prefix      = "VirtualNetwork"
        destination_address_prefix = "*"
    },
    {
        name                       = "allow-all-https"
        direction                  = "Inbound"
        access                     = "Allow"
        protocol                   = "Tcp"
        source_port_range          = "*"
        destination_port_range     = "443"
        source_address_prefix      = "VirtualNetwork"
        destination_address_prefix = "*"
    },
    ]

    firewall_application_rules = [
        {
            name = "microsoft"
            action = "Allow"
            source_addresses = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
            target_fqdns = ["*.microsoft.com"]
            protocol = {
                type = "Http"
                port = "80"
            }
        },
    ]

    firewall_network_rules = [
        {
            name = "ntp"
            action = "Allow"
            source_addresses = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
            destination_ports = ["123"]
            destination_addresses = ["*"]
            protocols = ["UDP"]
        },
    ]

}
```

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics settings can be sent to either storage account, event hub or Log Analytics workspace. The variable `diagnostics.destination` is the id of receiver, ie. storage account id, event namespace authorization rule id or log analytics resource id. Depending on what id is it will detect where to send. Unless using event namespace the `eventhub_name` is not required, just set to `null` for storage account and log analytics workspace.

Setting `all` in logs and metrics will send all possible diagnostics to destination. If not using `all` type name of categories to send.

## DDos protection plan

If `create_ddos_plan` is set it will deploy a [ddos protection plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview) to offer full protection. Together with Application Gateway WAF activated and threat intelligence in Azure Firewall it will offer full protection.

It uses the premium DDos protection plan that offers more advanced protection, but at a cost. Since only one is required per region that should not increase cost too much.

Coupled together with Azure Application Gateway WAF it provides [full layer 3 to layer 7 mitigation capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview#types-of-ddos-attacks-that-ddos-protection-standard-mitigates).

## Network watcher

If defining the input variable `netwatcher` it will create a Network Watcher resource. Since Azure uses a specific naming standard on network watchers it tries to conform to that. It will create a resource group NetworkWatcherRG in location specific in `netwatcher` input variable.

## Storage account

All flow logs are stored in a storage account creted by hub. Since flow logs do not support using service endpoints at the moment it cannot use network policy to restrict access. This might be implemented later and will be activated when possible.

## Subnets

Creates 4 subnets by default: GatewaySubnet, AzureFirewallSubnet, ApplicationGateway and Management.

| Name                 | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| GatewaySubnet        | Should contain VPN Gateway if deployed.
| AzureFirewallSubnet  | Deploys an Azure Firewall that will monitor all incoming and outgoing traffic
| ApplicationGateway   | Should contain an Application Gateway if deployed
| Management           | Management subnet for jumphost, accessible from gateway

Both GatewaySubnet and AzureFirewallSubnet allow traffic out and can have public ips. ApplicationGateway and Management subnets route traffic through firewall and does not support public ips due to asymmetric routing.

## Network security groups

By default the network security groups connected to Management and ApplicationGateway will only allow necessary traffic and block everything else (deny-all rule). To add additional NSG rules use the `mgmt_nsg_rules` and `appgw_nsg_rules` variables.

These variables support all properties allowed by `azurerm_network_security_rule` resource. Priority property will be set automatically. It will also set these default values:

```terraform
direction    = "Inbound"
access       = "Allow"
protocol     = "Tcp"
```

## Firewall rules

Input variables `firewall_application_rules`, `firewall_network_rules` and `firewall_nat_rules` can be used to define firewall rules. See variable input object for which parameters are required.

## Peering

To peer spoke networks to hub it requires that the service principal that performs the peering has Network Contributor role on hub network. To grant service principal this access use the `peering_assignment` input variable. Send a list of all service principals that should have access to peer against hub network.

## Private DNS Zone

To create a private dns zone for virtual network set the domain name for zone with variable `private_dns_zone`. This will create a private dns zone and link the virtual network hub to zone. It will also assign all principals that have peering access as contributors so spokes can be linked to same zone.
